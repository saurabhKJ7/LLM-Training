# Thinking Mode Application - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete Python application that demonstrates **chain-of-thought reasoning with self-consistency** through majority voting over multiple AI completions.

## Core Features Implemented

### 🧠 Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Prompts AI with "Let's think step-by-step" for structured problem solving
- Encourages detailed mathematical reasoning for GRE-style word problems

### 🗳️ Self-Consistency via Majority Voting
- Generates 10 completions with temperature=1.1 for variation
- Extracts numerical answers from each completion
- Performs majority vote to select the most consistent answer

### 📊 Comparative Evaluation
- **Method A**: Single deterministic run (temperature=0)
- **Method B**: Majority vote over 10 completions
- Accuracy comparison across multiple problems

### 🎯 Built-in Test Problems
10 GRE-style arithmetic word problems including:
- Shopping calculations (apples/oranges pricing)
- Rate problems (train distance/time)
- Fraction problems (marble distribution)
- Geometry (perimeter calculations)
- Set theory (pizza/burger preferences)

### 🔧 Answer Extraction System
Sophisticated regex patterns to extract numerical answers from natural language:
- "The answer is X"
- "Total cost = $X"
- "Final answer: X"
- Context-aware number extraction

## Application Structure

### Main Files
- `thinking_mode.py` - Full OpenAI API integration
- `demo_thinking_mode.py` - Mock responses for testing without API
- `quickstart.py` - Interactive menu interface
- `test_installation.py` - Comprehensive testing suite

### Support Files
- `api_test.py` - API connection verification
- `quick_test.py` - Fast functionality check
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `.env` - API key configuration

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Robust Answer Extraction
Multiple regex patterns handle various response formats:
```python
patterns = [
    r'(?:final answer|answer|result|total)(?:\s*is|\s*:)\s*\$?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)',
    r'(?:therefore|thus|so),?\s*(?:the answer is)?\s*\$?(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)',
    # ... more patterns
]
```

### 2. Error Handling & Validation
- API connection testing
- Dependency verification
- Graceful failure handling
- Comprehensive logging

### 3. Realistic Demo Mode
- Pre-written completions with natural variation
- Simulated calculation errors (10% probability)
- Same interface as full version

### 4. Statistical Analysis
- Answer distribution tracking
- Accuracy metrics
- JSON result export for analysis

## Demonstrated Concepts

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
Shows how "Let's think step-by-step" improves mathematical problem solving by encouraging:
- Step-by-step calculation breakdown
- Clear reasoning chains
- Explicit intermediate results

### Self-Consistency
Demonstrates how multiple diverse completions can be more reliable than single responses:
- Temperature=1.1 creates variation
- Majority voting reduces individual errors
- Statistical robustness over single attempts

### Prompt Engineering
Examples of effective mathematical problem prompting:
- Clear problem statement
- Explicit step-by-step instruction
- Structured response format

## Usage Scenarios

### Cost Considerations
- 11 API calls per problem (1 deterministic + 10 majority vote)
- ~$0.50-1.00 total cost for full 10-problem evaluation
- Demo mode completely free for testing concepts

## Extensibility

### Easy to Extend
